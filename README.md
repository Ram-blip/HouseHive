# üè° HouseHive

**HouseHive** is a full-stack Pinterest-style web application tailored for home and interior design inspiration. Users can upload, browse, and organize images related to rooms, decor styles, and layouts ‚Äî creating a visual board of their dream home. 

This project is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

I built HouseHive to get hands-on experience with:
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for data fetching and caching
- **Zustand** for managing global state Management
- Using `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks
- Implementing **infinite scrolling** to load content as you scroll
- Integrating **ImageKit** to handle image uploads and real-time optimization
